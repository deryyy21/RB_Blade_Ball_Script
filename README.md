 Blade Ball is a popular Roblox title with several innovative game modes. Its rules are simple. When players enter the playing field, the ball spawns and immediately begins to follow one of them around. In order to survive, this person has to hit the ball, making it fly even faster in the direction in which it was hit.


If players don't block the ball, they die, and the ball will appear again and target somebody else. The winner is the last person standing. As is the case in similar Roblox games, players are provided with several different options for diversifying gameplay. However, these generally need to be bought using coins, which are most easily obtained by redeeming Blade Ball codes.
